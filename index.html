					<h2>Restaurants and Bars</h2>
					<p id="testP" class="funParagraph">My first job was as a busser at Pumpernickle's Deli on the weekends when I was 15. I really loved the fast pace and the people. "The Industry," as restaurant and bar workers call it, became my fallback work whenever I felt I needed change from whatever I was doing at the time. I worked in a wide variety of Industry spots, from fast casual places like Steak 'N Shake to nicer places like Duff's to blues bars like Beale on Broadway to places in the middle like Picadilly at Manhattan. I liked the chaos, commoradory, and, at times, seediness in the industry, but despite advancing to managerial roles, I never felt there was much of a future in it without working 80 hours a week. And I really like free time.</p>

					<h2>Valet</h2>
					<p>I always liked cars, but as a 19 year old, I did not have the money for anything better than the beat Corolla I was driving. So when I saw an add for valet drivers at a well known upscale hotel in the Central West End, I jumped at the opportunity. I got to drive cars I don't expect I will ever be able to afford: new Porche 911s, BMW M3s and M5s, etc., etc. I loved running to the parking garage to fetch a customer's absurdly expensive car, blairing Nelly, which played on the radio constantly at the time, and tearing around the block to the front of the hotel. It was a blast. But this job was really shadey. One of my coworkers regularly went to the break room and smoke crack, and I scratched a car, and the manager just cleaned the transfered paint off and returned it to the customer without telling them. Apparently, once you accept the vehicle, the valet is no longer responsible... Shade-ee! So when valeting your car, always look it over real good before taking it back!</p>

					<h2>Delivery Driver</h2>
					<p>My parents owned a food distributer, Lawrence Foodservice. I worked for them for a couple years, driving a delivery route. I enjoyed this work too. I was driving a 16 foot box truck around the city by myself, no boss hovering around. I knew my route and what I need to do, and I did it. We delivered a lot of raw chicken to Popeyes in the area, and those boxes were wet and heavy, and they stank. Other than that, I have no complaints about the work. I was just driving around, listening to the radio and seeing parts of the city I would never see otherwise.</p>

					<a name="Purchasing Bear"></a>
					<h2>Purchasing Bear</h2>
					<p>I worked for about a year a a well known build-your-own stuffed animal company, at their head office, as a purchaser. My business cards said I was a "Purchasing Bear." Cute. This was one of my least favorite jobs. I didn't purchase anything. The stores would put in a weekly order for supplies, and my job was to make sure the order was filled. I also allocated stuffing and boxes to the stores. My problem with this job was there was too much to do and not enough me. My boss was far from understanding, and the person I worked with hated me for reasons I could not figure out. I am sure I could have done something to make it work, but I was so stressed about the job, I could barely focus on my work, let alone improving my processes. 0/5 Stars.</p>

					<h2>Wedding/Event DJ</h2>
					<p>I took this job as a joke. I had just returned to college and neeeded something on the weekends. I didn't expect to be there more than a few months, but I ended up staying for over 5 years. On my second event, at a rural high school prom, a student came up to the table, pointed at me and yelled, "This music sucks and you suck!" I'm not completely sure why I found that so funny. It was probably because it seemed so absurd to me that someone would be so rude. Maybe I have some masochistic tendancies, but that hooked me. I also really liked my coworkers. My friends were more punk rock, but my DJ friends liked pop music and dancing, and they were kind of cheesey. It really opened up another part of my personality, and I gained some life-long friends.</p>

					<h2>High School English Teacher</h2>
					<p>I taught in a city high school for 7 years. I don't think I have love/hated any job as much. I loved and still love my students. I doubt I will ever feel as much love sent my way as I did in that school. My students saw me as consistent, and stable role model. Clearly, they didn't know me that well, but it encouraged me to be the best version of myself for them. And wwhen I failed at that, they were so forgiving and accepting. They made me feel like an important part of thier lives and community. I hated leaving them. It felt like abandonment even though I know they understood. I felt and still feel that the district is toxic. Actual support is minimal. Solutions took the form of blame. Ill concieved directives are forced just long enough to create distress before they are abandoned. I feel horrible for the students, but my job often felt like bearing witness more than helping. It was crushing my soul.</p>

					<h2>Used Car Salesman</h2>
					<p>This is my current job. I started about the same time as LaunchCode. I took this one out of curiousity, knowing I would only be doing it until I could work in tech. It feels almost like a full circle. I enjoy driving all the cars. I like some of my coworkers, but I often feel like I don't fit in. I feel this way a lot in life, but it's more at this job. There is a lot of macho around. Most, if not all, my coworkers are really in to guns. Many are really into combat sports. There is a lot of talk about sex. In a lot of ways, it reminds of restaurant/bar culture with its inapproriate humor and teasing, but there is a level of dishonesty and hostility I can't stand. Luckily, this comes from a minority of people, so there are still good friends to be made. </p>
